I created a facial emotion recognition system using neural networks for real-time analysis of human expressions, aimed at enhancing user engagement and experience in digital interfaces.
Facial expressions play a vital role in nonverbal communication among people, and researchers have extensively studied the perception, production, and interpretation of these expressions. As facial expressions are crucial in human interaction, the computer vision-based automatic recognition of Facial Expressions (FER) enables numerous novel applications in fields such as data analytics and human-computer interaction.

Addressed the challenge of handling a highly unbalanced dataset (FER2013) by employing various techniques such as SMOTE, Random Oversampling, and Augmentation to achieve data balance.

Developed and assessed over 50+ distinct models from scratch, spanning Fully Connected Neural Networks to Convolutional Neural Networks.

Explored Transfer Learning using pre-trained models like Inception and VGG16.

To run the program: Program>program.py
